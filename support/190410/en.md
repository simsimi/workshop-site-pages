### What is small talk?
Small talks are idle talks, chitchats, jokes and etc that people take in without setting a specific topic.

---

### Does chatbot need small talks?
Many of the conversations people share are casual talk. People tend to think of chatbots as people, so they try to casual conversations with chatbots, but all the current generation chatbots are not very good at it, so people feel very different from them and then only give them some limited work orders. If your chatbot is a little better at small talk, users will feel friendly to it.

---

### Who uses the Smalltalk API?
Approximately 30,000 developers (companies or individuals) have used or are using the Smalltalk API, including the previous generation API (SimSimi Conversation API). Some of them are big companies like Baidu, Sanrio, and some are anonymous developers who use millions of requests steadily.

---

### Can I write small talks for my chatbot myself?
It's a great challenge, but it's hard to come by now. You can tell from the level of casual talks of chatbots from global corporations. Although small talk is not difficult for people, it is a consensus of many researchers that it can not be overcome by the current generation of computers and software. That's why it's hard to find an alternative to SWS's Smalltalk API when you need small talk in your chatbot.

---

### What features and benefits does SWS Smalltalk API have?
SWS's Smalltalk API allows chatbots to have friendly conversations with people based on a large amount of live expressions and a carefully tuned conversation processing engine that have been accumulated over more than 15 years with the chichatting chatbot 'SimSimi'.

---

### How are the sentences provided by the Smalltalk API created?
Sentences submitted by some of the SimSimi users using the 'Teach' function. SimSimi is a small talk dedicated chatbot, with hundreds of millions of users around the world having conversations with it. Of these, tens of millions of anonymous users voluntarily submitted their own inspirational sentences.

---

### Does the Smalltalk API provide all of the sentences that the SimSimi service has accumulated?
Basically yes. Unlike the SimSimi chatbot service, which excludes sentences that have a certain level of bad word probability according to the content policy, the Smalltalk API does not have this restriction. You can control the bad word probability of sentences from the Smalltalk API to your service. There are a few exceptions, for example, sentences with the risk of personal information leakage may be excluded.

---

### How do I control the bad word probability level of sentences provided by the Smalltalk API?
Set the atext_bad_prob_max parameter when requesting an API. The Smalltalk API returns sentences with a bad word probability of 0% in the answer text(atext) if this value is 0.0, and sentences with a bad word probability of 70% or less if this value is 0.7.

Quotas protect SimSimi Workshop from unforeseen spikes in usage. However, as your usage of SimSimi Workshop increases, you can request an increase in your quota.
